abstract: Early clinical and descriptive studies postulated that the alignment of the spine affects injuries due to impact loading and injury mechanisms. Later field studies confirmed this postulate in sports-related activities. Biomechanical studies have applied loading to post mortem human surrogate (PMHS) head-neck complexes and reported failure loads and deformations. The risk of effect of the initial alignment on the type of injury, however, has not been quantified. In line with the aims of the symposium, the present study proposes an “analytical tool to assess injury risk.” Competing risks analysis (CRA) to statistically quantify this curvature-based parameter in the production of head-neck trauma is presented in this study.
