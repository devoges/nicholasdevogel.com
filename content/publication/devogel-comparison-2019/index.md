abstract = "Adjusting for genetic similarity between individuals is an important aspect to consider when analyzing family data. This similarity can come from two sources, additive and dominance, that can be incorporated as random effects in a linear mixed model to induce the genetic correlation between the individuals. However, testing whether additive or dominance effects exist, or are necessary to adjust for, leads to a non-standard hypothesis test on the variance components that places the components on the boundary of the parameter space. Additionally problematic is the existence of nuisance variance components.  As such, no standard testing method exists for this situation. This study compares different variance component testing procedures for this non-standard test on additive or dominance familial genetic effects in linear mixed models. The testing procedures include restricted likelihood ratio, F-statistic, and score tests. The comparison of these tests will be based on false positive rates and powers estimated from simulations studies where family structured data is simulated from the 1000 Genomes Project with varying levels of true genetic correlation."
